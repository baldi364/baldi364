### ABOUT ME

Hello everyone! I'm Nicol√≤, a 28-year-old enthusiast about programming, determined to grow in the world of technology. 

After completing high school with a scientific background, I embarked on my professional journey with a series of experiences that helped me develop strong relational and organizational skills, essential for teamwork and client interaction.

My passion for programming led me to undertake a training path as a Junior Java Developer with Generation Italy. During this journey, I had the opportunity to delve into the backend world where I learned **Java**, **MySQL**, **Spring and Spring Boot**, as well as experiment with frontend technologies like **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.
I worked hard, both individually and in teams, on projects ranging from website creation to complex database management, following the **Agile methodology**.

Subsequently, I continued my growth path by attending an advanced Java course, where I deepened topics such as **Spring Boot**, **Hibernate**, and **microservice creation**. I also had the opportunity to put my skills into practice in a work environment where I worked on **JUnit**, Java exercises, and the creation of applications with Spring Boot and JPA.

I am convinced that dedication and constant improvement are *essential* to achieve both professional and personal goals. I am excited to continue my journey in the programming world, tackling challenges with passion and determination.
